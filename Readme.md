Description:
An optimized search tool for cpp reference [https://en.cppreference.com/], on which there isn't a high-efficient in-page search toolbar.
This is a html page, so you can integrate it into your own server (to jump to offline pages), on your computer (jump to local pages) or elsewhere (could be set to jump to original pages of en.cppreference.com).
Relative links or online links could be configured with command.
